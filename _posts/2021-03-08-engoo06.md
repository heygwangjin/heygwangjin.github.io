Getting enough sleep is known to be good for you. But a study has found that sleep quality may be even more important than quantity for mental health in young adults.  

A recent study published in *Frontiers in Psychology* looked at more than 1,100 young adults aged 18 to 25 living in New Zealand or the US. Participants completed a survey about their sleep, diet and exercise habits. They also answered questions about their mental health, including **ones designed** to measure symptoms of depression and mental well-being.  

Sleep quality was measured by asking participants how **refreshed** they felt when they woke up.  

After **adjusting** for lifestyle factors such as **obesity** and smoking, the researchers found that **sleep quality was the strongestt predictor of good mental health**.  

"This is surprising because sleep recommendations **predominantly** focus on quantity rather than quality," said lead author Shay-Ruby Wickham. "While we did see that both too little sleep -- less than eight hours -- and too much sleep -- more than 12 hours -- were associated with higher depressive symptoms and lower well-being, sleep quality significantly **outranked** sleep quantity in predicting mental health and well-being."  

After sleep quality, sleep quantity was the strongest predictor fo good mental health. This was followed by physical activity, where more exercise was associated with both fewer symptoms of depression and better mental well-being.  

However, the researchers said that it's not clear if these behaviors were responsible for positive feelings, or if the opposite was true. For example, depressive symptoms may **be responsible for** poor sleep quality, not the other way around -- though other studies have found that poor sleep more often comes before the **onset** of depression in young adults.  

According to the National Sleep Foundation, good sleep quality includes things like __waking up no more than once during the night__, __falling asleep within 30 minutes of going to bed__ and __being asleep for at least 85% of the time you're in bed__.

I think it is necessary to know all the young adults including me. Because we donâ€™t have enough time to sleep, so I think it is very useful inforamtion for us.
