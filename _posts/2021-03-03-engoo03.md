Have you ever met a bartender who can make the perfect drink, dance and speak eight languages? Probably not! But those traveling on MSC Virtuosa will be introduced to Ron, the cruise ship’s new robot bartender.  

Rob is not the first robot to make or serve drinks — he is not even the first robot bartender on a cruise ship. But Rob’s owner, Swiss company MSC Cruises, says he is the first humanoid robot bartender on a ship. Rob is able to make different facial expressions, and even tells jokes.  

The robot will welcome guests into MSC Virtuosa’s Starship Club bar where they can ask him to make any cocktail they want.  

Human bartenders will also be available to help guests.        

The MSC Virtuosa is the company’s newest ship and its first trips will be short cruises in the Mediterranean lasting three, four and 10 nights. It will then head to Northern Europe this summer.  

The ship has five swimming pools, 11 places to eat, 21 bars, a theater, a waterpark and other activities for guests. There are almost 2,500 rooms available that can hold over 6,000 guests.  

The company also says the MSC Virtuosa is one of the most environmentally friendly ships **at** sea. It **is been built** using technology to help it release less pollution, save energy and have less of an impact on sea life.  

Executive chairman Pierfrancesco Vago says the company hopes to oneday have “zero-impact” **on** the environment.
