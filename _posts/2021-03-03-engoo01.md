## Article
* * *
Are you the kind of person who only needs to hear something once to be able to remember it? Or maybe you have to write everything down, or often have people reminding you about things.  

Whatever type of memory you have, one of these expressions should help you describe it:  

People with a “photographic memory” are able to remember a lot of details about something they have seen — as though their mind has taken a photo of it. On the other hand, if you have a “mind like a sieve” everything you see or learn seems to fall out of your brain soon after.  

With forgetful people, it’s sometimes necessary to “jog their memory,” or do or say something to help them remember.  

But if you have told someone the same thing over and over again and they still can’t remember it, you might feel like your words are “going in one ear and out the other.” We use this phrase when someone hears something, but forgets it quickly.  

When you are able to remember something exactly, like the words of a poem, or a recipe, you can say you have “committed it to memory.” You can also say that you have “learned it by heart,” which likely comes from the ancient belief that the heart controlled our thoughts and emotions.  

And if you have such a strong or clear memory of something that it would be impossible to forget it, you can say that it is “etched into your memory.”
