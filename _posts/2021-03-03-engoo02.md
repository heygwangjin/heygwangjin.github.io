Road trips allow you to see a lot more than people traveling by plane or train, but they also require a lot more planning.  

Here are three pieces of advice for planning the perfect road trip.  

**Decide on a route**  

Plan a route by looking at a map or searching online for interesting places to visit. It’s also a great idea to talk to friends or family who have been to an area before to help you decide what places are worth visiting.  

Check how long it takes to drive between each place you want to see, and make sure it’s not too far. You should aim to drive for no more than seven hours a day, although less is even better. Driving for more than 10 hours without stopping can be dangerous due to tiredness.  

**Plan where you’ll stay**  

Whether you choose to stay in hotels or rent a camper on your trip, it’s best to plan where you’ll sleep each night so you know where you need to drive to each day.  

If you’re on a budget, book your accommodation about three or four weeks before your trip, when it’s often cheaper.  

**Allow extra time**  

Just because you have a plan doesn’t mean you have to stick to it. Give yourself extra time on your trip so you can stop if you drive past something that looks interesting. You can also take a detour to somewhere that isn’t on your route, or take a route that’s longer but has better scenery.  

## Discussion

1. Have you ever been on a road trip? If so, please share your experience. If not, would you like to?
- I have never been on a road trip. However, I would like to go on a road trip someday, if I can, but I don’t know when it is. If I will go on a road trip, I will keep in mind these advices.
2. If you could go on a road trip anywhere in the world, where would you choose? Why?
- If I could go on a road trip, I would choose U.S.A. Because U.S.A. is so vast so I will be able to see many beautiful places, and I think I will be able to have a broader perspective.
3. How do you usually search for interesting places to visit while traveling? 
- I usually use the Internet to search for interesting places while I am traveling.
4. Would you like to own a camper van? Why? Why not?
- I don’t want to own a camper van. Because I like traveling, but not enough to want to own a camper van.
5. Have you ever driven more than 10 hours without a break?
- No I haven’t. It will probably be very hard. Because I’ve driven for 3 hours without break, and I felt like I was going to die.
